    "description": "An infrared spectroscopy dataset on Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor resistance. Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) is a common blood disease caused by a chromosomal translocation creating a chimeric tyrosine kinase (BCR-ABL) that is permanently active and causes uncontrolled proliferation of blood progenitor cells. CML crises can be very effectively treated by using drugs called Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (TKI), but TKI resistance appears in some patients that prompted the development of new generation TKIs. However, the T315I mutation renders BCR-ABL kinases resistant to all generations of TKI (resistance to imatinib, dasatinib or nilotinib). The dataset is from the Sandt et al. (2018) study where murine embryonic stem cells were used to evaluate the T315I mutation in a stem cell context, mimicking the blood progenitor context. The question was whether we could separate the cells expressing the mutated BCR-ABL from the cells expressing the wild type BCR-ABL. Murine embryonic GS2 cells (mES GS2) were transduced either with MIGR, MIGR-BCR-ABL or MIGR-T315I vectors and grown on low-e slides. The dataset contains spectra of individual mES GS2 cells measured by synchrotron radiation FTIR microspectroscopy in transflection mode at 12x12 \u00b5m\u00b2 spatial resolution. Data was collected and compiled by Dr. Christophe Sandt.",
